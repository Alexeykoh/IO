# What is `<IO/>` ?
Lightweight component factory implementation with reactive primitives, state management, routing and asynchronous data loading.

## ⭐ Features
### 🗜 Components

> An element factory is a method of creating components with
> encapsulated data and functions.

### 🗄 States / AsyncStates

> States allow you to store data inside a component and pass access to it to its successors. States support caching, storage in local storage, and asynchronous loading of data via API.

### 📝 Native JS/TS

> `<IO/>`- a set of functions and classes of native JavaScript ES6 / TypeScript. This approach allows you to limitlessly expand the functionality and use the `<IO/>`as regular Javascript code

### 📻 Sreams

> A mechanism for reactively sending messages (data) to subscribers, built on the basis of the “Observer” pattern.

### 🍕 Ready Declarative Components / RDC

> RDC is a ready-made component based on the `<IO/>` element factory. It is a
> set of ready-made UI components with built-in functionality, such as:
> ready-made authorization:
> - forms
> - buttons
> - cards
> - navigation
> ... and others

### 🔀 Routing

> Routing allows you to use Page Templates and change them through switching functions like in SPA libraries.
